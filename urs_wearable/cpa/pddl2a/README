= CPA PLANNER version 1.0 : A sound, conformant planner        =
================================================================

1. Compilation
	make

    + Requirements:
	     flex, bison and a C++ compiler such as g++.

2. Usage
    cpa input_domain [options]

a) input_domain: A domain described in the AL language. This 
   version does not support variables.

b) Options
    -[pc|ph]
       Select an approximation to be used: pc for
       the possible-change approximation; ph for
       the possible-hold approximation.

    -e action1 action2 action3 ...
       Perform a sequence of actions and print out
       results step by step. The planner does not
       search for a plan.

c) Examples

    cpa blw.al -ph
       Search for a conformant plan using the ph-approximation
       The input domain is contained in the blw.al file.

    cpa blw.al -pc -e "move(2,table)" "move(1,2)"
       Execute the plan [move(2,table);move(1,2)] using the
       pc-approximation and print out results step by step.
